# Use my VNFM

In this section are described the REST interfaces which allow you to use your Virtual Network Function Manager (VNFM) with Openbaton's Network Function Virtualization Orchestrator (NFVO).

NFVO - VNFM ReST interface
===============================

The NFVO exposes a ReST interface for the communication with the VNFMs. The sequence diagram regarding the instantiation of a NetworkServiceRecord (NSR) is shown in the following picture.

![NFVO - VNFM ReST interface][or-vnfm-seq]

As shown in the picture, the NFVO calls some ReST methods on the VNFM in a particular order. Then it expects the corresponding call back. The different types of exchanges are described in the following sections. The ALLOCATE_RESOURCES call is not needed if the VNFM will take care of creating VMs. The communication with the EMS is particular to each VNFM. In order to be able to be found, the VNFM needs to register to the NFVO. This can be done through a particular registration call.

In the following 'Vnfm-Or' means that the VNFM sends to the NFVO and 'Or-Vnfm' means that the NFVO sends to the VNFM.

| Params          | Meaning       |
| -------------   | -------------:|
| _*OrEndpoint*_  | The endpoint of the NFVO (i.e. http://127.0.0.1:8080) |
| _*VnfmEnpoint*_ | The endpoint of the VNFM. This is given to the NFVO while registering      |



#### Registering a VNFM to the NFVO (Vnfm-Or)

This call registers a VNFM to an NFVO. 

###### request path
POST request on

_*OrEndpoint*_/admin/v1/vnfm-register
###### request body
```json
{
    "type":"dummy",
    "endpointType":"REST",
    "endpoint":"VnfmEndpoint",
    "description":"MyVnfm",

### INSTANTIATE (Or-Vnfm)

This call sends the Virtual Network Function Descriptor (VNFD) to the VNFM, which shall be used to create the Virtual Network Funtion Record (VNFR) and also sends to the VNFM all the scripts which are executed in actions like INSTANTIATE, MODIFY or START. This call triggers the creation of a Virtual Machine for the VNFCInstances specified in the sent VNFD and triggers the execution of the scripts which are associated with the INSTANTIATE lifecycle event in the VNFD.

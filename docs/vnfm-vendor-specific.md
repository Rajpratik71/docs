# Use my VNFM

In this section are described the REST interfaces which allow you to integrate your VNFM with Openbaton's NFVO.

NFVO - VNFM ReST interface
===============================

Nfvo exposes a ReST interface for the communication with the VnfManagers. The sequence diagram regarding the instantiation of a NetworkServiceRecord is shown in the following picture.

![NFVO - VNFM ReST interface][or-vnfm-seq]

As shown in the picture, NFVO calls some ReST methods on the vnfm in a particular order. Then it expects some kind of back call. The list of these call exchange is described in the following sections. The ALLOCATE_RESOURCES call is not needed if the vnfm will take care of creating VMs. The communication with the EMS is particular to each VnfManagers. In order to be able to be found, the Vnfm needs to register to the NFVO. This can be done through a particular call.

In the following 'Vnfm-Or' means that the Vnfm sends to the Nfvo and 'Or-Vnfm' means that the Nfvo sends to the Vnfm.

| Params          | Meaning       |
| -------------   | -------------:|
| _*OrEndpoint*_  | the endpoint of the NFVO (i.e. http://127.0.0.1:8080) |
| _*VnfmEnpoint*_ | the endpoint of the Vnfm. this is given to the nfvo while registering      |

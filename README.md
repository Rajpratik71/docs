[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/openbaton-docs/badge/?version=latest)](http://openbaton-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/?badge=latest)

## How to generate the documentation html

we are using mkdocs (http://www.mkdocs.org/) so that you can generate html files out of md. 

for generating the site folder with the html files: 
```bash
mkdocs build --clean
```

for seeing the results on a website:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```
